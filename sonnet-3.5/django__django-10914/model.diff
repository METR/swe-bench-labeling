+.. warning::
+
+    When ``FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`` is not explicitly set, the permissions for uploaded files
+    might be inconsistent depending on whether a ``MemoryUploadedFile`` or a
+    ``TemporaryUploadedFile`` was used for temporary storage. This depends on the size of the
+    uploaded file and the default ``FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS``. To ensure consistent permissions,
+    it's recommended to set ``FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`` explicitly in your settings.
+
+    The default value for ``FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`` is now ``0o644``. If you need different
+    permissions, make sure to set this value in your project's settings.
 Subclasses of ``UploadedFile`` include:
 
 .. class:: TemporaryUploadedFile
